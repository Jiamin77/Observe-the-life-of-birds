The Yellow River riparian corridor in Luoyang constitutes an important habitat for migratory birds, serving as a key stopover and resting area along migration routes. However, the current river-channel environment has been subjected to varying degrees of anthropogenic disturbance and degradation, which has adversely affected habitat quality and, consequently, the safety and viability of bird populations.

Grounded in an analysis of migratory birds’ behavioral patterns and species-specific safety-distance (buffer) requirements, this project proposes an integrated renewal strategy for both human-use areas and avian habitats. On the one hand, it enhances habitat provision through vegetation enrichment and community planting, optimization of revetment/bank structures, and the introduction of nesting and refuge spaces. On the other hand, while maintaining non-intrusion into core habitat zones, the design reduces human–wildlife disturbance by employing spatial screening, vertical adjustments, and circulation guidance. In parallel, it establishes designated birdwatching nodes and viewing spaces that combine environmental education with experiential value, thereby offering the public safe and sustainable opportunities for bird observation.
